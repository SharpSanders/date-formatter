# Date Formatter

A clean and simple JavaScript tool that displays today’s date in multiple formats.  
Built to practice the **JavaScript Date Object**, time formatting, dynamic UI updates, and DOM event handling.

This project is part of my frontend development journey and demonstrates working with dates, dropdown menus, and responsive styling.
